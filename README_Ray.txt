Ray
_________




My implementation of Ray is pretty weird at places
and definitely not the smartest way to do it, however
It could definitely be much worse. I think that all
the requirements work correctly and overall the output
is pretty good, however...


Problems
_________

My implementation has two flaws that I know of, In the
shadows of some objects there is a bit of aliasing that
I'm not sure what the source is, mainly in mirror test
with shadows and reflections on and no texture mapping,
the reflections on the ground show edged shadows. The other
problem that I think I have is with texturing spheres but
I have no clue why that is. My implementation is also fairly
slow as I have not acceleration structures and I did not
implement multi-threading.



Overall I think that i Implemented all the requirements




Thanksss!!!!
